# Stormful

Stormful, the beautiful thought/task management service that you use everyday!

## What does it do?

* Help you organize your thoughts
* Help you create todos from your thoughts
* Help you get over barricades while you think
* And many more to come ðŸ˜‰!


## Why does it exist?

Because this is what the world needs. A todo app that does not screw you, or want money from you at every step. Stormful may be a paid service in the future(probably), to cover expenses of serves & AI services. However, it is, and it will always, be easy to host & use. This is where this app differs, you choose what you want, and what you want to sacrifice!

## The mission, the big picture

The big picture is this => Creating the best core apps, and making them fully open-source, easy to operate, and never sacrifice the UX/DX.

## The standards

* Security is always the biggest priority
* User experience is a *must* in this day and age
* Simple, always simple; a UI should not include 500000 buttons
* Fast, everything should be fast, as fast as possible. If user gains 10% gain, server may give up 20% efficiency âœŠ
* Easy to host & manage. All this stuff must be well documented, and accessible, always
* Commits should be semantic. Crazy techniques are more than welcome, please do what no one before you did!

## The tech stack

* Elixir/Phoenix with LiveView, latest version possible
* PostgreSQL, because it is very flexible
* TailwindCSS, as said earlier with LiveView, with LiveView hooks. AlpineJS might be needed in the long run, but for now LiveView hooks
* Any AI provider, this is a different topic, provider-agnostic Elixir GenAI client library is in the making, for now, Anthropic is used for R&D
* Hosting should be documented for on prem(probably with Docker), fly.io, Heroku. Other providers may be added by the community, once they have been added, it will be appended to this list.


We *will* make a difference!

Into the storm! âš¡âœŠ
