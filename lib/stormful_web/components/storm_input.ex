    The JSON structure should be:

    {
      "type": "reminder",
      "what": "the reminder that needs to be done/set-up",
      "when": "a string for the reminder, can be relative or absolute with annotations, like relative:day:+1, absolute:2025-06-08 12:00"
      "the_time_of_the_day_if_day": "the time of the day if the system provides days"
      "location": "the location if the user provides it"
    }

    User generally tells when they need something done by a specific time. We extract date/time in a unique way:
    - User says tomorrow -> relative:day:+1
    - User says in 2 hours -> relative:minute:+120
    - User says in 2 days -> relative:day:+2
    - User says in 2 weeks -> relative:week:+2
    - User says in 2 months -> relative:month:+2
    - User says in 2 years -> relative:year:+2
    - User says in 2 hours -> relative:minute:+120
    - User says in 2 days -> relative:day:+2
    - User says 2025-06-08 -> absolute:2025-06-08
    - User says 2025-06-08 12:00 -> absolute:2025-06-08 12:00
    - User says 2025-06-08 12:00:00 -> absolute:2025-06-08 12:00:00
    - User says 2025-06-08 12:00:00.000 -> absolute:2025-06-08 12:00:00.000
    - User says 2025-06-08 12:00:00.000+03:00 -> absolute:2025-06-08 12:00:00.000
    - User says 2025-06-08 12:00:00.000+03:00 -> absolute:2025-06-08 12:00:00.000

    Beware: if user provides absolute, they might mean in mm/dd/yyyy format, but we need yyyy-mm-dd format. If you ever get confused, leave the field empty:
    - User says 06/08/2025 -> confused_ask:2025-06-08
    - User says 06/08/2025 12:00 -> confused_ask:2025-06-08 12:00
    - User says 06/08/2025 12:00:00 -> confused_ask:2025-06-08 12:00:00
    - User says 06/08/2025 12:00:00.000 -> confused_ask:2025-06-08 12:00:00.000
    - User says 06/08/2025 12:00:00.000+03:00 -> confused_ask:2025-06-08 12:00:00.000
    - User says 06/08/2025 12:00:00.000+03:00 -> confused_ask:2025-06-08 12:00:00.000

    Program will take care of that afterwards, don't worry about it.

    You also might want to provide the_time_of_the_day_if_day, which is the time of the day if the user says a day. You may go logical here, if undecided, leave it null. Should always provide in 24-hour format. But yeah, if user says:
    - I got to go to school tomorrow -> the_time_of_the_day_if_day: 09:00
    - I got to go to school in 2 hours -> the_time_of_the_day_if_day: null
    - I will take a good looking person to dinner tomorrow -> the_time_of_the_day_if_day: 18:00

    User may specify the location too, location is optional, if not provided or not clear, leave it null.
    - I got to go to the dentist tomorrow -> location: null
    - dentist appointment tomorrow at Stonefruit Bakery -> location: "Stonefruit Bakery"

    For example, if the user says "I got to go to the dentist tomorrow", and user timezone is UTC+0, you should respond with:
    {
      "type": "reminder",
      "what": "Go to the dentist",
      "when": "relative:day:+1"
      "the_time_of_the_day_if_day": "09:00"
      "location": null
    }

    Or when user says "I got a dentist appointment in 2 hours at Stonefruit Bakery", and user timezone is UTC+0, you should respond with:
    {
      "type": "reminder",
      "what": "Go to the dentist",
      "when": "relative:minute:+120"
      "the_time_of_the_day_if_day": null
      "location": "Stonefruit Bakery"
    }


    Please try to respond in the language of the user.

    If user provides a data that is not a reminder, you should respond with null.

    User will provide a thought, and you need to extract if it has a reminder that needs to be done/set-up. Please be mindful of the user's timezone. Also keep in mind about date/time related stuff as I mentioned above, you need to be extra careful with timezone, it is very important for our user's experience. Please only provide the JSON structure, no other text:

    "#{wind.words}"
    """
